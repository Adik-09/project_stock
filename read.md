# project stock.

I have made this to test my django skills in websockets and celery. This project is basic real time stock price indicatir and a simple graph based visualization 
of the stocks. I haved used websockets ans celery to update the stock data in real-time.
I have used a library yfianace for getting the stock data.

* how to use ?


In this app I wrote the backend logic and html and javaScript but css is done by AI.
